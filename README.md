# Random Disney Quote Generator!

My introductory lesson in learning JavaScript. 
I familiarized myself with the use of functions such as Math.floor() and Math.random() and multiplied it by (quotes.length) which helped assure that I could add as many quotes as I like and not have to change the number of strings each time I added a quote to the array. I also learned how to use document.getElementById() to display the randomly generated quote when I press the button! I also took some time to beautify it with some CSS. This was a great project to get started with JavaScript!

All rights for the quotes belong to Disney; Tutorial I followed was by Sophanarith Sok for the freeCodeCamp Medium article "How to build a random quote generator with JavaScript and HTML, for absolute beginners" found at https://medium.freecodecamp.org/creating-a-bare-bones-quote-generator-with-javascript-and-html-for-absolute-beginners-5264e1725f08
